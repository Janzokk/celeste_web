                    <p>Celeste is a 2018 platform game designed, directed and written by Maddy Thorson and programmed by Thorson and Noel Berry. It is a fully-fleshed version of the 2016 PICO-8 game of the same name,[note 4] which was made in four days solely by Thorson and Berry during a game jam. Set on a fictional version of Mount Celeste, it follows a young woman named Madeline who attempts to climb the mountain, and must face her inner demons in her quest to reach the summit.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Celeste was released worldwide independently on January 25, 2018, on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, macOS, and Linux, followed by a release on Stadia on July 28, 2020. It consists of eight chapters, plus a free downloadable content chapter titled Farewell released on September 9, 2019. Farewell acts as an epilogue to the main story and adds 100 new screens.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Celeste received universal acclaim upon release, and was largely considered one of the best games of 2018. It received high praise for its gameplay, level design, soundtrack, themes, and emotional story, as well as for Madeline's characterization; it was also singled out for being demanding yet enjoyable for both casual players, and those seeking to speedrun it or complete all of its optional achievements. It won many awards, including the Best Independent Game and Games for Impact awards at The Game Awards 2018, where it was also nominated for Game of the Year. Celeste was also a financial success, selling over a million copies by the end of 2019 and largely exceeding its creators' expectations, while also becoming a hit in the speedrunning community.

                    <p>Celeste is a platform game in which players control a young woman named Madeline as she makes her way up Mount Celeste while avoiding various deadly obstacles.  Alongwith jumping and climbing up walls for a limited amount of time, Madeline has the ability to perform a mid-air dash in eight directions. This move initially can only be performed once and must be replenished by either landing on the ground, hitting certain objects such as floating crystals, or moving to a new screen; later on in the game, the player is granted the ability to do two mid-air dashes.
                        <br><br>
                        Combining dashes with movement in various ways can be used by the player to gain more speed than usual or access areas before they are supposed to.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout the game, the player will encounter additional mechanics, such as springs that launch the player or feathers that allow brief flight, and deadly objects such as spikes which kill Madeline
                        <br><br>
                        Some of these advanced movement mechanics are shown to the player as they progress the late stages of the game. Examples include the wavedash, superdash, hyperdash, ultradash and an unintended feature, the demodash as we'll see in the next video.
